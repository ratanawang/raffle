# raffle

This is a raffle draw simulator that was made for a fundraiser. It can take in the names and grades of students and save them to a separate file so that the program can be used over several days of fundraising. The separate file can be manually edited. The program can remove the last entry, print the number of items sold, or print the number of people who have bought something (without duplicates). A random lucky winner can be chosen from the list as well.
